I'm implementing a couple of Terraform projects and building resources rapidly.

Terraform has been the game changer in IaC in the cloud world, where things are done differently.

understanding how to fix the resource by configuring the resource name is key to having a build without error

Terraform is most used because of its integration with other cloud providers.
